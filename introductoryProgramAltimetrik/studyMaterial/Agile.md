# Agiles Methodologies | Scrum

Software development contemplates a lot of processes and sometimes big teams to get the work done, as an answer to the need to have a guide to how to deal with these processes, how to organize the tasks, and teams, the agile methodologies emerged in the ’60s with the creation of Iterative and incremental development but this kind of methodologies doesn’t get to be called Agile until 17 developers wrote a manifesto called Manifesto for Agile Software Development. 

Before this kind of methodologies have a name a lot of frameworks were added, some of them are:

- Rapid application development (RAD)
- The unified process (UP) 
- Dynamic systems development method (DSDM)
- Scrum
- Crystal Clear
- Extreme programming (XP)
- Kanban
- Lean

Although these all originated before the publication of the Agile Manifesto, they are now collectively referred to as agile software development methods.

The most successful one is Scrum. But what is scrum?

It’s a framework presented by two Japanese: Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka. They published the article [“New New Product Development Game”](https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/86116-PDF-ENG) in the Harvard Business Review.

The authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility. Their inspiration came from case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier, and printer industries.

Simplified Scrum is:

- At a high level, Scrum is lightweight and easy to understand, but when you dig in you will find that it is difficult to master.
- Scrum is a framework or model; it is not a process.
- Scrum does not tell you how to do things, it tells you what needs to be done and lets you figure out how to do it. 
- To make it even more confusing, Scrum is not literal; you must modify what it says to match your circumstances.
- Scrum is a well-balanced framework, all its parts are needed in order to be effective.

## The Scrum Events

Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.  The Scrum Events are:

- Sprint
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

**Sprint:** This is a cycle of work in scrum they can have a duration between 2 and 4 weeks.

**Sprint Planning:** It’s the beginning and organization of the cycle that is about to start, you organize teams, tasks, etc.

**Daily Scrum:** It’s a team meeting to review the status of the tasks.

**Sprint Review:** It’s the review of all the goals reached or not during the sprint.

**Sprint Retrospective:** It’s an evaluation of time and quality and how to improve it.

This methodology is regularly customizable depending on the personal workflow, you can use Scrum with another agile method, the most common for this in use kanban or lean kanban.

The kanban is a visual workflow management method that complements scrum, and also lean. Why does this happen? These methodologies are great because they contemplate the workflow of each task, it’s not the whole big picture process like Scrum. These frameworks are more detailed and work perfectly with each task inside the sprint, in the way the person interacts with the task.
