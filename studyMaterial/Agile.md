# Agiles Methodologies | Scrum

Software development contemplates a lot of processes and sometimes big teams to get the work done, as an answer to the need to have a guide to how to deal with these processes, how to organize the tasks, and teams. 

The first one called the cascade model or waterfall conceived as a set of stages that are executed one after the other. It is named for the positions that occupy the different phases that make up the project, placed one on top of another, and following a flow of execution from top to bottom, like a waterfall.

But, being honest this wasn’t the best or fast for developing solutions, have important disadvantages:

- In many cases, customers do not know the requirements they will need before they see a first version of the software in operation. Then, many requirements will change and new ones will be added, which will mean replacing phases that have already been overcome and will cause an increase in costs.
- The product is not shown to the client as it is being developed, but the result is seen once the entire process has been completed. This causes insecurity on the part of the client who wants to see the progress in the product.
- Designers may not take into account all the difficulties they will encounter when designing software, which will entail redesigning the project to solve the problem.
- For long-term projects, this model can pose a problem by changing the user’s needs over time. If for example, we have a project that will last 5 years, it is very likely that the requirements need to adapt to the tastes and novelties of the market.

So, in response to this unsatisfactory and inefficient method, the agile methodologies emerged in the ’60s with the creation of Iterative and incremental development but this kind of methodologies doesn’t get to be called Agile until 17 developers wrote a manifesto called **Manifesto for Agile Software Development.** 

Before this kind of methodologies has a name some frameworks were added, some of them are: 

- Scrum
- Crystal Clear
- Extreme programming (XP)
- Kanban
- Lean

Although these all originated before the publication of the Agile Manifesto, they are now collectively referred to as agile software development methods.

The most successful one is Scrum. But what is scrum? A framework. 

What is a framework?
A basic structure underlying a system, concept, or text. A programming language tells the computer what it should do. Every programming language features a syntax and a particular set of rules, which need to be followed every time the code is written.
A software framework is built on top of a programming language. For example,
Rails, also known as Ruby on Rails, is a web framework built on top of the Ruby programming language.
Django and Flask are two different web frameworks built on top of the Python programming language. Hence, they are also known as Python frameworks. React, and Angular are front-end web frameworks built on top of the JavaScript programming language.
Having the knowledge of what is a framework we can talk about scrum.

Scrum is a framework presented by two Japanese: Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka. They published the article “New New Product Development Game” in the Harvard Business Review.

The authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility. Their inspiration came from case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier, and printer industries.

Simplified Scrum is:

- At a high level, Scrum is lightweight and easy to understand, but when you dig in you will find that it is difficult to master. 
- Scrum is a framework or model; it is not a process.
- Scrum does not tell you how to do things, it tells you what needs to be done and lets you figure out how to do it. 
- To make it even more confusing, Scrum is not literal; you must modify what it says to match your circumstances.
- Scrum is a well-balanced framework, all its parts are needed in order to be effective.


## Scrum Roles

Scrum has three roles:

**Product owner:** It’s the one who sets the clear path and aligns the business objectives with the development team. He manages the scrum backlog, releases, and stakeholders.
Managing the scrum backlog - This does not mean that they are the only ones putting new product backlog items into the backlog.

***Release management*** - The sprint is not a release cycle, but instead a planning cycle. That means that scrum teams can deliver at any time.

***Stakeholder management*** - Any product will have many stakeholders involved ranging from users, customers, governance, and organizational leadership. The product owner will have to work with all these people to effectively ensure that the development team is delivering value. 

**Scrum master:**  The scrum master is the leader with the responsibility of managing the tasks of the team on a day-to-day basis.
Transparency - To effectively inspect and adapt it is important that the right people can see what is going on.

***Empiricism*** - Empirical process is not easy and requires the scrum master to coach the scrum team on breaking down work, describing clear outcomes and reviewing those outcomes

***Self Organization*** - The scrum master will encourage team members to step outside their comfort zone and try different things and use practices such as ‘delegation poker’ to expose and challenge predefined ideas about role boundaries and responsibilities.

***Values*** - Scrum defines 5 values of courage, focus, commitment, respect, and openness not because they are nice to have, but because they create an environment of physiological safety and trust.

**Development team members:** The development team are the people that do the work. At first glance, you may think the “development team” means engineers. But that’s not always the case. According to the Scrum Guide, the development team can be comprised of all kinds of people including designers, writers, programmers, etc.

## Agile Estimation
Estimation techniques are in use by teams using agile approaches such as Scrum and others, these techniques help the teams to estimate time and effort for each task. The scale of numbers used is the Fibonacci’s sequence of numbers, these numbers instead represent the relative size, not time. 

**Planning poker:**

The numbers are represented in a set of playing cards. Team members play “Planning Poker” to provide an estimate in the form of a point value for each item. Here are the steps:
- Each team member gets a set of cards.
- The business owner (who does NOT get to estimate) presents the item to be estimated.
- The item is discussed.
- Each team member privately selects a card representing his/her estimate.
- When everyone is ready, all selected cards are revealed at the same time.
- If all team members selected the same card, then that point value is the estimate.
- If the cards are not the same, the team discusses the estimate with emphasis placed on the outlying values:
-The member who selected the lowest value explains why he/she selected the value.
-The member who selected the highest value explains why he/she selected the value.
- Select again until estimates converge.
- Should lengthy or “in-the-weeds” conversations result, team members may use a two-minute timer to timebox the discussion.

**Affinity Grouping:**

An even faster way to estimate, and one used when the number of items to estimate is large, is affinity grouping. Team members simply group items together that are like-sized. The method is simple and fast:

- The first item is read to the team members and placed on the wall.
- The second item is read and the team is asked if it is smaller or larger than the first item; placement on the wall corresponds to the team's response (larger is to the right, smaller is to the left).
- The third item is read and the team is asked if it is smaller or larger than the first and/or second items; the item is placed on the wall accordingly.
- Control is then turned over to the team to finish the affinity grouping for the remainder of the items.    

This is done with all team members working in parallel until all items have been assessed and placed on the wall. Several hundred items can be estimated in a relatively short time. Once all items are on the wall, the team reviews the groupings. Items that a team member believes to be in the wrong group are discussed and moved if appropriate.

Once affinity grouping is complete, estimation unit values such as points can be assigned.

## The Scrum Events
Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.  The Scrum Events are:

- Sprint
- Sprint Planning
- Daily Scrum
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

**Sprint:** This is a cycle of work in scrum they can have a duration between 2 and 4 weeks.
Sprint Planning: It’s the beginning and organization of the cycle that is about to start, you organize teams, tasks, etc.

**Daily Scrum:** It’s a team meeting to review the status of the tasks.

**Sprint Review:** It’s the review of all the goals reached or not during the sprint.

**Sprint Retrospective:** It’s an evaluation of time and quality and how to improve it.

This methodology is regularly customizable depending on the personal workflow, you can use Scrum with another agile method, the most common for this in use kanban or lean kanban.
The kanban is a visual workflow management method that complements scrum, and also lean. Why does this happen? These methodologies are great because they contemplate the workflow of each task, it’s not the whole big picture process like Scrum. These frameworks are more detailed and work perfectly with each task inside the sprint, in the way the person interacts with the task.
