# What Is SEO / Search Engine Optimization?
SEO stands for “search engine optimization.” In simple terms, it means the process of improving your site to increase its visibility when people search for products or services related to your business in Google, Bing, and other search engines. The better visibility your pages have in search results, the more likely you are to garner attention and attract prospective and existing customers to your business.

**How does SEO work?**
Search engines such as Google and Bing use bots to crawl pages on the web, going from site to site, collecting information about those pages and putting them in an index. Think of the index like a giant library where a librarian can pull up a book (or a web page) to help you find exactly what you’re looking for at the time.

Next, algorithms analyze pages in the index, taking into account hundreds of ranking factors or signals, to determine the order pages should appear in the search results for a given query.

In programming there are many ways to improve this first with meta-tags, the meta-tags it’s the first things that search engine bots are going to read (reading code is line per line) so, if you put a good title, description, keywords, it helps you ranking. Then you have the usage of friendly URLs 

E.g.  

https://www.example.com/games/gta-v  

instead of  

https://www.example.com/fdf433/j34345345344jfkvedf  

The speed of the page it’s key for this, and the Open Graphs Meta Tags.

# What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

In simple words the DOM is all the components that make the document, it’s the bridge to other languages to manipulate these components, and makes the document dynamic.
